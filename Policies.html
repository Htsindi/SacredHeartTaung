              <p> We aim to mould the character of our children through spiritual guidance and quality education so that they may become useful citizens who will serve the society and the country selflessly.</p>

              <p>We provide an educational environment conducive to the holistic development of the learner; this includes the formation of attitudes and values inspired by the spirituality of unity in the Catholic Church.</p>

              <p>We admit South African boys and girls who are willing to uphold the morality and values based on Christian principles; who have the ability to meet our internal standards of education; whose families are able to commit themselves to our school fees; who have the aptitude to develop and realise their potential as participating, responsible and compassionate citizens of our country.</p>

              <p>We are a fully-fledged Catholic School with Religious Education. We also aim to uplift and empower learners who may be from a disadvantaged background and who have the potential to benefit from our kind of school and who will carry the ethos into their community.</p>

              <p>Where vacancies exist we accept boys and girls who are not South African citizens.</p>

          <p>Our present facilities enable us to include children with mild to moderate educational problems, limited emotional difficulties and slight physical disabilities.

          <p>In cases where prospective learners require greater assistance than our facilities can offer, and where more than two learning areas require significant therapy or where a facilitator is required for the child to function effectively it is our obligation to recommend a suitable alternative.

          <h2 class="mb-5">CATHOLIC ETHOS</h2>

          <h3>THE ETHOS OF THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL</h3>

          <p>To ask, ‘what is the ethos of the catholic school?’ is to try to get at the fundamental purpose of the school, its ultimate meaning and where its value system comes from.</p>
          <p>In a world, which ignores the human thirst for God, we are called to share the living water of our faith. In a time when there is little reverence for the image of God in the human person, we are summoned to care for the human life with and ultimate respect.</p>
          <p>(From This Moment of Promise, Ontario Conference of Catholic Bishops)</p>
          <p>The religious Education Policy document for South Africa Catholic School, Fostering Hope, answers the question in this way:</p>
          <p>The Catholic School exists as an expression of the Catholic Church’s mission to share the gospel Jesus.</p>
          <p>(Fostering Hope p 5)</p>
          <p>What is the Catholic School particularly called to do in sharing the gospel?  How do we recognise the authentic Catholic School?</p>

           <ul>

                <li> The authentic Catholic School is founded on the person of Jesus Christ and is enlivened by gospel values.</li>

                <li>The authentic Catholic School highlights the relevance of our faith to life, and to contemporary culture and concerns.</li>
                <li> The authentic Catholic School, embedded within the community of believes; share in the evangelising mission of the Church.</li>
                <li>The authentic Catholic School is committed to quality education and the development of the whole person.</li>
                <li>The authentic Catholic School does not exist for the Catholic community alone, but is at the service of all members of the community.1</li>
          </ul>

          <P>Catholic Schools are at one and the same time places evangelisation, well-rounded education, enculturation and initiation to the dialogue of life among young people of different religious and social backgrounds.</P>
          <P>(African synod #102; The Church in Africa)</p>
          <p>It is clear from this that Religious Education will from an integral part of the Catholic School curriculum.</p>
          <p>The Catholic school, as an organ within the Body of Christ, is called to make Christ visibly present to the world in its own particular way.  It is called to bring the light of Christ to every dimension of its educational enterprise.  It does this through its Religious Education by offering, in the Catholic tradition, the Good News of Jesus Christ as a light to illumine every individual search for the meaning of life, and the way to live it.  It does so, not in competition with other faith traditions, but in a spirit of dialogue, so that all are affirmed in their own, and enriched by one another’s traditions, recognising that the on Holy Spirit is at the heart of every quest for the Truth.</p>
          <p>(All are God’s people, p5)</p>
